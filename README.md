# vulnerability-match-labels

This repo contains labeled vulnerability-package match pairs for select container images. These labels are used as a ground truth for evaluating the performance of vulnerability scanner tools (such as [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)). The label data structure is governed by the `artifact.LabelEntry` from [yardstick](https://github.com/anchore/yardstick), the tool used to create these labels.

SBOMs for images with labels are stored as artifacts within the `ghcr.io/anchore/vml-sbom/*` container registry for convenience. 

To see this data in action see [`test/quality` in the grype repo](https://github.com/anchore/grype/tree/main/test/quality).
